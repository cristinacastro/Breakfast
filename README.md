# Project 1

In Project1 app you will find recipes to make varied healthy breakfast. If you're done with cheese and jam sandwitch Project1 offers you alternatives to the typical breakfast menu still present in every coffee shop and bar. And last but not least, all our recipes include no cereal! 

***Project1*** was developed using JavaScript as part of the [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/) developer bootcamp (WebDev-FT-092029) using the [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/) API.
